### plant-shelf
a shelf - for plants - obvs

This is a Vanilla Javascrip, HTML, and CSS project for Module 1 of the [Get Coding Program](https://www.getcoding.ca/).  The purpose of this project was to create an online storage solution for my house plants and quickly access their watering requirements!! It evolved over the course of the development but overall I'm pretty happy with how it turned out! 

The site can be found [here](https://jackiebarry.github.io/plant-shelf/)

On first site visit an adorable gif loops while the plant options are being pulled from the API and stored in localstorage - once that process is complete plants can be added with the handy dandy 'add your plant' button! On revisit the gif loop will be much shorter as the site populates your shelves with your plants! The list can be searched for your desired plant. The options are relatively limited with the free API but their pro list is super comprehensive and amazing - but I was too cheap to spring for that! 

Once added to the shelves, you can toggle water info on or off, organize the plants on your shelf by dragging between the plant boxes, or delete them if need be! All your plants get stored in localstorage meaning on refresh your plants stay in their respective places! If you need extra space you can also add another shelf! 

This project wouldn't have been possible without the [plant API](https://perenual.com/docs/api) I used and I am so grateful for having been able to access their free version! 

Also big thanks to [Material Design for Bootstrap](https://mdbootstrap.com/) as I used various components/icons/styling in order to make this page what I wanted it to be!

Love this [super adorable gif](https://medium.com/@essentialdesign/turning-your-office-into-a-green-space-3f76c13b266) and appreciate it's online access 

And last but not least - biggest thanks to my amazing mentor / instructor [Jill Breau](https://github.com/jillBreau) through the [Get Coding Program](https://www.getcoding.ca/) 

If you made it this far - thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy my lil project!!
